## Day 15

*Midterm Presentation Day!*

Peer Review Format:

* Open your website on one of your peers' computers. Use your own to take notes about the feedback you receive, things you discover in this process, and ways to improve your site. You will email me this along with your [Midterm Self-Assessment](https://github.com/IDMNYU/DM-UY-2193-A/blob/master/midtermselfassessment.md).

* First, allow time for each member of your group to navigate the site on their own.

* Then demonstrate and show, then walk through how you built the site.

* When feedback is being offered, allow each person to speak without interruption. You are to simply receive the information.

* Allow a couple of minutes for questions at the end of each project.

Peer Review Framework:

* Is the concept evident? Is it clear what this site is about? If so, why? If not, why not?

* Is the site well organized? Does the layout and navigation make sense? If so, why? If not, why not?

* Has attention been paid to spelling, alignment, image preparation/resolution?

* What are the strongest elements? What would you recommend to strengthen the site?

## Homework
