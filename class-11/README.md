### Homework

* Prepare for your midterm! You will be creating a fully functioning website, styled with CSS. It is up to you if it is multiple pages or just one HTML page, but every design element must be well considered.

    * A concise elevator pitch: What are you making? Why? Your content should be well considered. You should be able to articulate the need or intention for the website you will be creating. "It looks cool" is not enough of a reason. "It is a piece of experimental net-art that looks cool" might. But probably not.

    Some thought starters for what kind of site you could make- a page for your imaginary design studio, a fansite about a game, musician, or artist you like, a site advocating for a social cause you care about, etc...

    * Begin collecting references to organize a mood board of images, inspirations, color palette, etc. that demonstrate the look and feel

    * Think about a basic sitemap.

    * NOTE: Due to the scheduling change next week, I will assess if this assignment will be due next week on the 16th, or Monday the 21st.
