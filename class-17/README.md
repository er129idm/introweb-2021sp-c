### Homework ðŸŽƒ

Using Bootstrap, create a one-page website that serves as an invitation or promotional site for a real or fictional Halloween party- it could be for a small halloween event with friends or something as big as a music festival. Up to you!

This page should use Bootstrap column and / or size classes to automatically adapt from Desktop to Mobile.

Note: Feel free to base your page off of any of the default Bootstrap examples, or any "Bootstrap Templates" you find on the internet. This is the **one assignment** where it's okay to include a lot of different example code.
