* Javascript Animation!
    * code-along: animating a cat
    * More interaction events
    * Creating DOM elements on the fly
    * Combining JSON with Animation techniques


* Question / assistance lightning round!
  * We will begin locking in what your final project for this course will be, and it's key that we all try our best to get on the "same page".

### Next Week:

* Final Project

### Homework:

#### OPTION 1

1. Display an image of an animal on your HTML page

2. You are going to now use JS DOM manipulation do "decorate" that animal. The decoration should be triggered by some type of user event. However you decorate the animal is up to you! You can draw on it, put a hat on it, make it wear makeup, etc.

3. Include an image of a hat or a moustache or something else amazing that your pet might want to wear. Allow the user to click on the animal and have that click move the object to that position on the pet.

#### OPTION 2

1. Use JSON to define a set of multiple things to animate around the page (images, specially formatted text, abstract blocks of color, etc...)

2. In the JSON structure, include some kind of "speed" properties

3. Write javascript timers and / or loops to allow these items to move around the browser like a screen saver.
