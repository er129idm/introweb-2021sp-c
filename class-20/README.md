## Day 20 – Week 10b

- Intro to structured data with JSON
- Manipulating the DOM with dynamic content

#### Helpful Links:

- [JavaScript createElement](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_createelement.asp)
- [JavaScript appendChild](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_node_appendchild.asp)

### Homework:

Use JSON to create a collection of “items”, displaying them in a structured manner on your page.

Some ideas are a portfolio page, collection of music, “about us” section with individual profiles, or something abstract and artful.

- Each item **must use at least three pieces of information or data** that are displayed visually- text, images, number of sub-items, colors, etc…

- Use all your skills as a designer/developer; this should be laid out nicely and demonstrate as much effort as the other websites you’ve made.

#### Deliverable format:

- Upload and host your site via GitHub Pages as usual and send me the link.
