## Welcome to Day 1!

* Introductions

* Go over syllabus & class requirements. This is a contract between students + professor, so it is important we're all on the same page!

* Learning Goals:
  * Why am I in this class? Why have I chosen to be sitting here NOW?

  * What do I hope I will learn?

  * What are my goals?

  * What content do I think will help me accomplish my learning goals?

* What is Web Development?

* [Slides from today](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xUyn2fCw0eY05uulNM33B-gNWwcjqadEzm6MkdIs3ag/edit?usp=sharing)


### Post-class Communique
```
Hello Web Developers!

::: HOMEWORK – DUE FOR PRESENTATION IN CLASS ON MONDAY 09/09 :::

Now that we have learned the absolute basic structure of
what makes a web page functional– make something... anything!

Use the tags we covered in class and produce any
composition, artwork, digital poetry, or website.

You will be expected to extensively browse and begin
getting acquainted with W3Schools ( https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp )

Review their sections of what we covered in class:
HTML Basics, HTML Elements, HTML Styles.

Make sure to review the following sections:
HTML Attributes, HTML Images, HTML Links.

And browse their CSS page to apply inline
( https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp )

-- HOMEWORK DELIVERABLE: --

Your piece must:
- Have the correct basic structure (<html>, <body>, content...)
- Use at least three (3) different tags in the body.
- Additionally, use at least one image. <img>
- Use the "style" attribute at LEAST one (1) time.
- Contain comments about what the lines of HTML do.
  note: This is the one time your commenting can be generalized, if needed.

::: LASTLY :::

As we saw in class today, we have students with a WIDE range
of prior experiences. It is important that we operate in a way
that is respectful to that diversity of knowledge.

Those of you who have programming experience:
I expect you to focus on what we are learning from assignment to assignment-
there are ways to push your technical capabilities and STILL stay on topic
with what the entire class is learning, together. I promise!

I'm looking forward to this semester with all of you– see ya Monday!
